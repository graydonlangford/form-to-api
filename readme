Simple test app to server a page with a form

When the form is posted to the server, the server then sends select portions of the data to an external api

INSTALLATION

Built in node.js 4.4.4, npm 2.15.1 so ensure you have compatable versions.

Clone repo, then run ''npm i'' to install all dependancies.

Run the server with ''node app.js'' or for additional features, ''npm run dev''.
